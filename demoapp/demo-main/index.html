      <h4>virat kohli</h4>
      <p>Virat Kohli is one of the finest cricketers of the modern era, known for his passion, consistency, and aggressive style of play. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, he began playing cricket at a young age and gained national recognition after leading India to victory in the 2008 ICC U-19 World Cup. Later that year, he made his debut for the Indian senior team and quickly rose to prominence with his solid technique and hunger for runs. Kohli is known for his exceptional batting skills across all formats of the game. He has scored over 25,000 international runs and holds numerous records, including the fastest century in ODIs by an Indian. Often called “The Chase Master,” Kohli is especially renowned for his ability to perform under pressure. As captain, he led India to many significant victories, including a historic Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. His leadership, fitness, and discipline set new standards for Indian cricket.

        <p>Virat Kohli is not just a cricketer—he's my inspiration, my pride, my emotion. Every time he walks onto the pitch, my heart races. His passion, his grit, his fire—it speaks to my soul. Through his struggles, I’ve learned resilience. Through his victories, I’ve felt joy like no other. I’ve cried with him, screamed with him, believed in him when the world doubted. That cover drive? Pure art. That roar after a century? Pure heart. He carries not just the bat, but the hope of a billion. <br><b>HE IS THE HEARTBEAT OF INDIAN CRICKECT.ALWAYS FOREVER.</b>
